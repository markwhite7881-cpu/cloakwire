// ConfigBuilder.tsx imports the same for its `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` so
// the two never drift apart (which is exactly what happened in
// v0.3.0 — App.tsx was 77.88.8.8 while ConfigBuilder.tsx was 1.1.1.1).
//
// DNS defaults are 77.88.8.8 (Yandex) for users in Russia; Cloudflare
// 1.1.1.1 is a fine global fallback but the user-visible defaults
// have been the Russian ones since 0.3.0.
